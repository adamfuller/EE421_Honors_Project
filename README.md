# EE 421 Communication Systems Honors Project
For this project we intend to explore the planning, development, and construction of the hardware used in variable frequency analog to digital and digital to analog conversion systems. Develop software to provide a live comparison of multiple input signals, including: frequency domain representation, high-pass filtering, low-pass filtering, and band-pass filtering. Develop software to control a single or multiple output system utilizing a digital to analog converter.
